		"A": "Data security policies should be reviewed/refreshed once every year to reflect changes in the organization's environment. Policies are fundamental to the organization's governance structure, and, therefore, this is the greatest concern.",
		"B": "Although it is a concern that there is no policy related to system patching, the greater concern is that the information security policy is not reviewed periodically by senior management.",
		"C": "Mission statements tend to be long term because they are strategic in nature and are established by the board of directors and management. This is not the information systems (IS) auditor's greatest concern because proper governance oversight can lead to meeting the objectives of the organization mission statement.",

		"C": "Risk avoidance",
		"D": "Risk mitigation"

	  "correct_answer": "B",
	  "justifications": {
		"A": "Risk reduction is a term synonymous with risk mitigation. Risk reduction treats the risk, including compliance risk and lowers it to a level commensurate with the organization's risk appetite.",
		"B": "Risk transfer spreads the risk by either transferring some or all of it to a third party (e.g., through insurance or outsourcing) or applying the resources of multiple teams to hedge against possible losses. Risk transfer typically addresses financial risk and does not always address compliance risk.",
		"C": "Risk avoidance does not expose the organization to compliance risk because the business practice that caused the inherent risk to exist is no longer being pursued or is eliminated altogether.",
		"D": "While mitigating risk will still expose the organization to a certain amount of risk, risk mitigation lowers risk, including compliance risk, to a level commensurate with the organization's risk appetite."
