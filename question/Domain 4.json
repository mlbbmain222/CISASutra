        "B": "A due diligence activity, such as reviewing physical security controls, is a good practice, but the SLA\nis most critical because it defines what specific levels of security are required and makes the provider\ncontractually obligated to deliver what was promised.",

      "justifications": {
        "A": "The absence of a right to audit clause or other forms of attestation that the supplier is compliant\nwith a certain standard would potentially prevent the information systems (IS) auditor from\ninvestigating any aspect of supplier performance moving forward, including control deficiencies,\npoor performance, and adherence to legal requirements. The absence of this clause would be a\nmajor concern for the IS auditor because it would be difficult for the organization to assess whether\nthe appropriate controls were implemented.",
        "B": "Although a clear definition of penalty payment terms is desirable, not all contracts require the payment\nof penalties fbr poor performance. When performance penalties are required, these penalties are often\nsubject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the absence of this information is not as\nsignificant as a lack of right to audit.",
        "C": "Although the inclusion of service level report templates is desirable, if the requirement for service level\nreporting is included in the contract, the absence of predefined templates for reporting is not a significant\nconcern.",
        "D": "The absence of a limitation of liability clause for the service provider exposes the provider to unlimited\nliability. This is to the advantage of the outsourcing organization so, although the IS auditor might\nhighlight the absence of such a clause, it does not constitute a major concern."

        "B": "Organizations must review the regulatory environment in which the cloud provider operates\nbecause it may have requirements or restrictions of its own. Some service providers reserve\nthe right to access customer information (third-party access) to perform certain transactions\nand provide certain services. In the case of protected health information, regulations may\nrestrict certain access. Organizations must then determine whether the cloud provider provides\nappropriate controls to ensure data security.",
        "C": "An organization may eventually wish to discontinue its service with a third-party cloud-based provider.\nThe organization would then want to remove its data from the system and ensure that the service provider\nclears the system (including any backups) of its data.

      "B": "Normalization is a design or optimization process for a relational database that increases redundancy. Redundancy, which is usually considered positive for resource availability, is negative in a database environment because it demands additional and otherwise unnecessary data handling efforts.

      "C": "User spool limits restrict the space available for running user queries. This prevents poorly formed queries from consuming excessive system resources and impacting general query performance. Limiting the space available to users in their own databases prevents them from building excessively large tables. This helps to control space utilization, which itself acts to help performance by maintaining a buffer between the actual data volume stored and the physical device capacity. Additionally, it prevents users from consuming excessive resources in ad hoc table builds (as opposed to scheduled production loads that often can run overnight and are optimized for performance purposes).
