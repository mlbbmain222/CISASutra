        "A": "A Gantt chart is a simple project management tool which typically shows the timeline, status, and\nresponsible person fbr each task in the project. It helps with the prioritization requirement, but it is not as\neffective as program evaluation review technique (PERT).",
        "B": "Earned value analysis is a technique to track project cost versus project deliverables but does not assist\nin prioritizing tasks. It provides better clarity and control of the activities involved and enables project\nmanagers to respond to issues early.",
        "C": "The PERT method works on the principle of obtaining project timelines based on project events fbr\nthree likely scenarios~~worst, best and normal. The timeline is calculated by a predefined formula\nand identifies the critical path, which identifies the key activities that must be prioritized.",

Although the budget overruns mentioned above represent one form of project risk, they\nappear to be caused by implementing too much functionality, which relates more directly to project scope.",
        "D": "Project procurement management is defined as the processes required to acquire goods and services from\noutside the performing organization. Although purchasing goods and services that are too expensive can\ncause budget overruns, in this case, the key to the question is that implemented functionality is greater\nthan what was required, which is more likely related to project scope.\n182 CIS A ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition\n©ISACA.

        "B": "Using production data in the test environment does not cause test results to be inaccurate ; it has the\nopposite effect. Using production data improves the accuracy of testing processes, because the data most\nclosely mirrors the production environment.

What is the MOST\nsignificant advantage to the organization by using this strategy?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justifications": {
        "A": "Parallel operation is generally expensive and does not provide a cost savings over most other testing\napproaches. In many cases, parallel operation is the most expensive form of system testing due to the need\nfbr dual data entry, dual sets of hardware, dual maintenance and dual backups. Parallel operation is twice\nthe amount of work as running a production system and, therefore, costs more time and money.",
        "B": "Hardware compatibility should be determined and tested much earlier in the conversion project and is\nnot an advantage of parallel operation. Compatibility is generally determined based on the application's\npublished specifications and on system testing in a lab environment. Parallel operation is designed\nto test the application's effectiveness and integrity of application data, not hardware compatibility. In\ngeneral, hardware compatibility relates more to the operating system level than to a particular application.\nAlthough new hardware in a system conversion must be tested under a real production load, this can be\ndone without parallel systems.",
        "C": "Parallel operation provides a high level of assurance that the new system ftinctions properly\ncompared to the old system, and therefore, the new system meets its functional requirements. This\nis the safest form of system conversion testing because, if the new system fails, the old system is\nstill available fbr production use. In addition, this form of testing allows the application developers\nand administrators to simultaneously run operational tasks (e.g., batch jobs and backups) on both\nsystems, to ensure that the new system is reliable before unplugging the old system.",
        "D": "Increased resiliency during parallel processing is a legitimate outcome from this scenario, but the\nadvantage it provides is temporary and minor, so this is not the correct answer.\n184 CISA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition\n©ISACA.

      "justifications": {
        "A": "Alpha testing is the testing stage just before beta testing. Alpha testing is typically performed by\nprogrammers and business analysts, instead of users. Alpha testing is used to identify bugs or glitches that\ncan be fixed before beta testing begins with external users.",
        "B": "White box testing is performed much earlier in the software development life cycle than alpha or beta\ntesting. White box testing is used to assess the effectiveness of software program logic, where test data\nare used to determine procedural accuracy of the programs being tested. This testing stage determines if\nthe program operates the way it is supposed to at a functional level. White box testing does not typically\ninvolve external users.",
        "C": "Regression testing is the process of re-running a portion of a test scenario to ensure that changes or\ncorrections have not introduced more errors (i.e., the same tests are run after multiple successive program\nchanges to ensure that the fix for one problem did not break another part of the program). Regression\ntesting is not the last stage of testing and does not typically involve external users.",

The team\nconsiders and documents what worked well and what could have worked better at the end of each\niteration and identifies improvements to be implemented in subsequent iterations. Additionally,\nless importance is placed on formal paper-based deliverables, with the preference being effective\ninformal communication within the team and with key outside contributors. Agile projects produce\nreleasable software in short iterations, typically ranging from fbur-to-eight weeks, which instills\nconsiderable performance discipline within the team. These practices, combined with short daily\nmeetings to agree on what the team is doing and the identification of any impediments, render\ntask-level tracking against a schedule redundant.\n239\nCISA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manuall3th Edition\n©ISACA.

Metadata describes the data in the warehouse and aims to provide a table of contents to the stored information. Organizations that have built warehouses believe that metadata are the most important component of the warehouse.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justifications": {
        "A": "Testing and releasing a pilot with reduced functionality reduces risk in several ways. Reduced\nfunctionality should result in fewer test cases to run, fewer defects to fix and retest and less\nregression testing. A pilot release that is made available to a select group of users will reduce the\nrisk associated with a full implementation. All of the benefits of releasing the system to the full user\npopulation will not be realized, but some benefits should start to be realized. Additionally, some\nuseful comments from real users should be obtained to guide what extra functionality and other\nimprovements need to be included in an entire release.",
        "B": "When testing starts, a significant number of defects are likely to exist. Focusing only on the highest-\nseverity functional defects has the risk that other important aspects, such as usability problems and\nnonfunctional performance and security requirements, will be ignored. The system may go live, but users\nmay struggle to use the system as intended to realize business benefits.",
        "C": "Eliminating testing by development is not a good solution. Before system acceptance testing begins, some\nprior testing should occur to establish that the system is ready to proceed to acceptance evaluation. If prior\ntesting by development does not occur, there is a considerable risk that the software will have a significant\nnumber of low-level defects, such as transactions that cause the system to hang and unintelligible error\nmessages. These defects can prove frustrating for users or testers tasked with acceptance testing and,\nultimately, can cause the overall test time to increase rather than decrease.",
        "D": "The use of a defect tracking tool can help in improving test efficiency, but it does not address the\nfundamental risk caused by reducing the testing effort on a system in which quality is uncertain. Given\nthe build problems experienced, there is reason to suspect that quality problems can exist.\n241\nCISA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition\n©ISACA.
