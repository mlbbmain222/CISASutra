      "question": "Web application developers occasionally use hidden fields on web pages to save information about a client\nsession. This technique is used to store session variables that enable persistence across web pages, such as\nmaintaining the contents of a shopping cart on a retail website application. The MOST likely web-based\nattack due to this practice is:",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justifications": {
        "A": "Web application developers sometimes use hidden fields to save information about a client session\nor to submit hidden parameters, such as the language of the end user, to the underlying application.\nBecause hidden form fields do not display in the browser, developers may feel safe passing\nunvalidated data in the hidden fields (to be validated later). This practice is not safe because an\nattacker can intercept, modify and submit requests, which can discover information or perform\nfunctions that the web developer never intended. The malicious modification of web application\nparameters is known as parameter tampering.",
        "B": "Cross-site scripting involves the compromise of the web page to redirect users to content on the attacker\nwebsite. The use of hidden fields has no impact on the likelihood of a cross-site scripting attack because\nthese fields are static content that cannot ordinarily be modified to create this type of attack.",
        "C": "Web applications use cookies to save session state information on the client machine so that the user\ndoes not need to log on every time a page is visited. Cookie poisoning refers to the interception and\nmodification of session cookies to impersonate the user or steal logon credentials. The use of hidden\nfields has no relation to cookie poisoning.",
        "D": "Stealth commanding is the hijacking of a web server by the installation of unauthorized code. Although\nthe use of hidden forms may increase the risk of server compromise, the most common server exploits\ninvolve vulnerabilities of the server operating system or web server.\n373\nCISA ©Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition\n©ISACA.

        "A": "The inherent security features of global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology\ncombined with the use of a virtual private network (VPN) are appropriate. The confidentiality of\nthe communication on the GSM radio link is ensured by the use of encryption, and the use of a VPN\nsignifies that an encrypted session is established between the laptop and the enterprise network.\nGSM is a global standard for cellular telecommunications that can be used for voice and data.\nCurrently deployed commercial GSM technology has multiple overlapping security features that\nprevent eavesdropping, session hijacking and unauthorized use of the GSM carrier network. While\nother wireless technologies such as 802.11 wireless local area network (LAN) technologies have been\ndesigned to allow the user to adjust or even disable security settings, GSM does not allow any\ndevices to connect to the system unless all relevant security features are active and enabled.",
        "B": "Because the chief information officer (CIO) is using a VPN, it can be assumed that encryption is enabled\nin addition to the security features in GSM. VPNs do not allow the transfer of data fbr storage on the\nremote device (such as the CIO's laptop).",
        "C": "Media access control (MAC) filtering can be used on a wireless LAN but does not apply to a GSM\nnetwork device.",
        "D": "Because the GSM network is being used rather than a wireless LAN, it is not possible to\nconfigure settings for multifactor authentication over the wireless link. However, in other technology\nconfigurations, multifactor authentication is recommended because it will better protect against\nunauthorized access than single-factor authentication.\n377\nCISA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition\n©ISACA.

      "justifications": {
        "A": "A password-protected screen saver with a proper time interval is the best measure to prevent\nunauthorized access to unattended end-user systems. It is important to ensure that users lock the\nworkstation when they step away from the machine, which is something that can be reinforced via\nawareness training.",
        "B": "There are solutions that will lock machines when users step away from their desks, and those are suitable\nhere; however, those tools are a more expensive solution that normally include the use of smart cards and\nextra hardware. Therefore, the use of a password-protected screen saver is a better solution.",

    "question": "An enterprise is planning to replace its wired networks with wireless networks. Which of the following would BEST secure the wireless network from unauthorized access?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Implement wired equivalent privacy (WEP).",
      "B": "Permit access to only authorized media access control addresses.",
      "C": "Disable open broadcast of service set identifiers.",
      "D": "Implement Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 2."
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "justifications": {
      "A": "Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) can be cracked within minutes. WEP uses a static key that has to be communicated to all authorized users, thus, management is difficult. Also, there is a greater vulnerability if the static key is not changed at regular intervals.",
      "B": "The practice of allowing access based on media access control is not a solution, because media access control (MAC) addresses can be spoofed by attackers to gain access to the network.",
      "C": "Disabling open broadcast of service set identifiers is not an effective access control, because many tools can detect a wireless access point that is not broadcasting.",
      "D": "Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 2 implements most of the requirements of the IEEE 802.11i standard. The advanced encryption standard (AES) used in WPA2 provides better security. Also, WPA2 supports the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and the pre-shared secret key authentication model."

    "question": "Which of the following specifically addresses how to deal with unauthorized activity on the enterprise's IT systems and how to recover from an attack?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Incident response plan (IRP)",
      "B": "IT contingency plan",
      "C": "Business continuity plan (BCP)",
      "D": "Continuity of operations plan"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "justifications": {
      "A": "The incident response plan (IRP) determines the information security responses to incidents such as cyberattacks on systems and/or networks. This plan establishes procedures to enable security personnel to identify, mitigate and recover from malicious computer incidents, such as unauthorized access to a system or data, denial-of-service or unauthorized changes to system hardware or software.",
      "B": "The IT contingency plan addresses IT system disruptions and establishes procedures for recovering from a major application or general support system failure. The contingency plan deals with ways to recover from an unexpected failure, but it does not address the identification or prevention of cyberattacks.",
      "C": "The business continuity plan (BCP) addresses business processes and provides procedures for sustaining essential business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. Although a cyberattack can be severe enough to require use of the BCP, the IRP would be used to determine which actions should be taken both to stop the attack and to resume normal operations after the attack.",
      "D": "The continuity of operations plan addresses the subset of enterprise missions that are deemed most critical and contains procedures to sustain these functions at an alternate site for a short time period."
